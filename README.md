# Overview

This place is where I keep all the stuff for learning about machine learning (ML) every day. It's like a diary but for my ML projects. I got the idea from watching videos on a YouTube channel called [Dataquest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_lePY0Lm0E2-_IkYUWpI5A).

By following along with these projects, I've learned how to do big ML projects from start to finish.

# Prerequisites

If you want to try these projects, you should know:

* How to write in Python, including making functions, using conditional statements, and organizing data
* How to clean up data
* How to use Pandas to handle data operations
* How to work with Jupyter notebook
* The fundamental ideas of machine learning
